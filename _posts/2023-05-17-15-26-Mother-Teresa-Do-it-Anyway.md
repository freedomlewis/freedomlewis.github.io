People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered.  
**Forgive them anyway.**  

If you are kind,  
people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.  
**Be kind anyway.**  

If you are successful,  
you will win some false friends and some true enemies.  
**Succeed anyway.**  

If you are honest and frank,  
people may cheat you.  
**Be honest and frank anyway.**  

What you spend years building,  
someone could destroy overnight.  
**Build anyway.**  

If you find serenity and happiness,  
they may be jealous.  
**Be happy anyway.**  

The good you do today,  
people will often forget tomorrow.  
**Do good anyway.**  

Give the world the best you have,  
and it may never be enough.  
**Give the best you've got anyway.**  

You see,  
**in the final analysis it is between you and God;**  
**it was never between you and them anyway.**
