## What's the issue
I want to test a scan QRCode feature on the Android simulator, but I found it's unable to move the camera and also the image I set for the simulator not display in the camera preview screen.

## How to fix

If we want to move the camera in Simulator, follow the below settings:
* Run the simulator as a standalone App
