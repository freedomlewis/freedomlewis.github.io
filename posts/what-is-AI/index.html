This contrasts with narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.</p><h2 id="weak-artificial-intelligence"><span class="mr-2">Weak artificial intelligence</span><a href="#weak-artificial-intelligence" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of the mind, or, as Artificial Narrow Intelligence, is focused on one narrow task.</p><p>Narrow AI can be classified as being “limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.” Artificial general intelligence is conversely the opposite.</p><h1 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h1><p>Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.</p><h2 id="deep-learning"><span class="mr-2">Deep Learning</span><a href="#deep-learning" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on utilizing neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning. The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and “training” them to process data. The adjective “deep” refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p><p>Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.</p><h3 id="supervised-learning-vs-unsupervised-learning"><span class="mr-2">Supervised learning vs Unsupervised learning</span><a href="#supervised-learning-vs-unsupervised-learning" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>In supervised learning, the training data is labeled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabeled data.</p><p><img data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png" alt="SL-USL" data-proofer-ignore></p><h3 id="supervised-learning"><span class="mr-2">Supervised learning</span><a href="#supervised-learning" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>In machine learning, supervised learning (SL) is a paradigm where a model is trained using input objects (e.g. a vector of predictor variables) and desired output values (also known as a supervisory signal), which are often human-made labels. The training process builds a function that maps new data to expected output values.[1] An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to accurately determine output values for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a “reasonable” way (see inductive bias). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured via a generalization error.</p><h3 id="unsupervised-learning"><span class="mr-2">Unsupervised learning</span><a href="#unsupervised-learning" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>Unsupervised learning is a framework in machine learning where, in contrast to supervised learning, algorithms learn patterns exclusively from unlabeled data.Other frameworks in the spectrum of supervisions include weak- or semi-supervision, where a small portion of the data is tagged, and self-supervision. Some researchers consider self-supervised learning a form of unsupervised learning.</p><p>Conceptually, unsupervised learning divides into the aspects of data, training, algorithm, and downstream applications. Typically, the dataset is harvested cheaply “in the wild”, such as massive text corpus obtained by web crawling, with only minor filtering (such as Common Crawl). This compares favorably to supervised learning, where the dataset (such as the ImageNet1000) is typically constructed manually, which is much more expensive.</p><p>There were algorithms designed specifically for unsupervised learning, such as clustering algorithms like k-means, dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), Boltzmann machine learning, and autoencoders. After the rise of deep learning, most large-scale unsupervised learning have been done by training general-purpose neural network architectures by gradient descent, adapted to performing unsupervised learning by designing an appropriate training procedure.</p><p>Sometimes a trained model can be used as-is, but more often they are modified for downstream applications. For example, the generative pretraining method trains a model to generate a textual dataset, before finetuning it for other applications, such as text classification. As another example, autoencoders are trained to good features, which can then be used as a module for other models, such as in a latent diffusion model.</p><h3 id="weak-supervision"><span class="mr-2">Weak supervision</span><a href="#weak-supervision" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>Weak supervision (also known as semi-supervised learning) is a paradigm in machine learning, the relevance and notability of which increased with the advent of large language models due to large amount of data required to train them. It is characterized by using a combination of a small amount of human-labeled data (exclusively used in more expensive and time-consuming supervised learning paradigm), followed by a large amount of unlabeled data (used exclusively in unsupervised learning paradigm). In other words, the desired output values are provided only for a subset of the training data. The remaining data is unlabeled or imprecisely labeled. Intuitively, it can be seen as an exam and labeled data as sample problems that the teacher solves for the class as an aid in solving another set of problems. In the transductive setting, these unsolved problems act as exam questions. In the inductive setting, they become practice problems of the sort that will make up the exam.</p><h3 id="reinforcement-learning"><span class="mr-2">Reinforcement Learning</span><a href="#reinforcement-learning" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent should take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize a reward signal. Reinforcement learning is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p><p>Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed).The search for this balance is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma.</p><p>The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.</p><h1 id="data-science">Data Science</h1><p>Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.</p><p>Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.</p><p>Data science is “a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods” to “understand and analyze actual phenomena” with data.It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a “fourth paradigm” of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that “everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology” and the data deluge.</p><p>A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data.</p><h1 id="reference">Reference</h1><font color="gray" size="2">Artificial intelligence：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Learning<font> <font color="gray" size="2">Artificial general intelligence：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence<font> <font color="gray" size="2">Weak artificial intelligence：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence<font> <font color="gray" size="2">Machine learning：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning<font> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/tech/'>Tech</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/ai/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >AI</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What is AI - Lewis&#39;s Blog&amp;url=https://freedomlewis.github.io/posts/what-is-AI/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/summary-of-2025/">Review of 2025 & Hopes for 2026</a><li><a href="/posts/stop-doing-list/">Stop Doing List</a><li><a href="/posts/warning-list/">Warning List</a><li><a href="/posts/what-is-AI/">What is AI</a><li><a href="/posts/BBK-core-values/">步步高企业文化</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/android/">Android</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/my/">My</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/poem/">Poem</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/coroutine/">Coroutine</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/core-values/">Core Values</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/data-structure/">Data Structure</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/ai/">AI</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/architecture/">Architecture</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/habit/">Habit</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/LRUCache/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="timeago small" data-ts="1714449720" > 2024-04-30 </em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Unveiling the Android LRUCache - A Peek Under the Hood</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Ever wondered how Android keeps your frequently used data readily available while maintaining smooth performance?
